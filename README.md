# Overview-of-call-centers-in-the-US

# Description

The purpose of this dashboard is to give an overview of all the call centers of a company in the US.
I used the colours #1ee19a and #e11e65 to contrast call centers that are overloaded with calls.

# Findings:

A HR employee may use this dashboard to hire call center agents in certain states or cities according to the plots. For instance, the call center in Washington 
receives enormous number of calls compared to other cities. Hence, the HR employee can hire more agents at the call center in Washington.

The customer satisfaction score is very low so the service needs to be improved. 
However, keep in mind that the score is not representative of the parent distribution as many customers chose not to answer. 
The score might be also biased as dissatisfied customers are more likely to acturally give a rating than satisfied customers.

Main concerns of customers are about billing questions so updating commonly asked questions on the website can be helpful. 

The average call duration is insanely long for a customer support. This may be due to an error in my dashboard.
The dashboard could be improved if I can incorporate the number of agents at each call center and calculate the 
average number of calls each agent needs to handle. Just by looking at the dashboard, it is hard to tell whether 
the call centers in California are overloaded with calls.
